## 18CSL47, Design and Analysis of Algorithms of Laboratory ###

### List of Laboratory programs, with source code ###

    1. Create a Java class called Student with the following details as     variable within it:
    (i) USN
    (ii) Name
    (iii) Programme
    (iv) Phone
    Write a Java program to create nStudent objects and print the USN,
    Name, Programme, and Phoneof these objects with suitable headings.

    2. A. Design a superclass called **Staff** with
	details as StaffId, Name , Phone, Salary. Extend this
	class by writing three subclasses namely:
		**Teaching** (domain, publications)
		**Technical** (skills)
		**Contract** (period).
	Write a Java program to read and display at least 3 	staff.
	B. Write a Java class called Customer to store their
	name and **date of birth**. The date of birth
	format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to 
	read customer data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and
	display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using
	StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter
	character as “/”.
