## 18CSL47, Design and Analysis of Algorithms of Laboratory ###

### List of Laboratory programs, with source code ###

    1. A. Create a Java class called Student with the
	following details as variable within it:
    (i) USN
    (ii) Name
    (iii) Programme
    (iv) Phone
    Write a Java program to create nStudent objects
	and print the USN,
	Name, Programme, and Phone of these objects with
	suitable headings.
	
	B. Write a Java program to implement the Stack
	using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(), and Display()
	methods to demonstrate its working.
	
	
    2. A. Design a superclass called **Staff** with
	details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary. Extend this
	class by writing three subclasses namely:
		**Teaching** (domain, publications)
		**Technical** (skills)
		**Contract** (period).
	Write a Java program to read and display at least
	3 staff.
	
	B. Write a Java class called Customer to store their
	name and **date of birth**. The date of birth
	format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to 
	read customer data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and
	display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using
	StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter
	character as “/”.
	
	3. A. Write a Java program to read two integers
	**a** and **b**. Compute a/b and print, when b is 	not zero. Raise an exception when b is equal to zero.
